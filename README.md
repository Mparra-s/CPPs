# 📦 C++ Modules (CPP00 – CPP04)

## Description

The C++ Modules are a series of projects developed as part of the 42 curriculum.  
Their goal is to introduce modern C++ concepts progressively, focusing on object-oriented programming, memory management, and good design practices.

Each module builds upon the previous ones, gradually increasing complexity and introducing new language features.

<br/>

## Covered Modules

This repository currently includes the following modules:

- **CPP00** — Basics of C++, namespaces, classes, member functions, and I/O streams
- **CPP01** — Memory allocation, references, pointers, and object lifecycle
- **CPP02** — Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and canonical form
- **CPP03** — Inheritance and basic polymorphism
- **CPP04** — Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces

<br/>

## Project Objectives

- Learn the fundamentals of C++
- Understand object-oriented programming concepts
- Apply proper memory management
- Follow the Orthodox Canonical Form
- Write clean, modular, and maintainable code
- Respect the constraints and norms defined by 42

<br/>

## Repository Structure

Each module is contained in its own directory:

- CPP00/
- CPP01/
- CPP02/
- CPP03/
- CPP04/

Inside each directory, exercises are organized according to the subject specifications provided by 42.

<br/>

## Compilation

Each exercise includes its own Makefile.  
To compile an exercise, navigate to its directory and run:

```bash
make
```
Additional rules (when available):

```bash
make clean
make fclean
make re
```
